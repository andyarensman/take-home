## Instructions for Running the Project

- Download the project and open it in VS Code or other code editor

### Backend

- (IMPORTANT) Download the .env file I emailed, and add it to the backend folder. Rename it to `.env`. The dot is important
- Open a terminal (ctrl + \`) and navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
- Run the following code to install packages: `npm i`
- Run the backend: `npm start`

### Frontend

- Open a second terminal (plus button on right side of terminal window in VS code) and navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
- Run the following code to install packages: `npm i`
- Run the application: `npm start`
- It may take a little bit of time before the app starts running. The app should automatically open a browser window for you, but if it doesn't, go to `http://localhost:3000/`
